# Collagraph ðŸ““

Reactive user interfaces.

> The word [Collagraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagraphy) is derived from the Greek word _koll_ or _kolla_, meaning glue, and graph, meaning the activity of drawing.

Inspired by Vue and React.


## Features

Write your Python interfaces in a declarative manner with plain render functions, component classes or even single-file components using Vue-like syntax, but with Python!

* Reactivity (made possible by leveraging [observ](https://github.com/fork-tongue/observ))
* Function components
* Class components with local state and life-cycle methods/hooks
* Single-file components with Vue-like syntax (`.cgx` files)
* Custom renderers

Here is an example that shows a counter, made with a component with Vue-like syntax:

```python
from PySide6 import QtWidgets
import collagraph as cg

Counter, _ = cg.sfc.load_from_string(
    textwrap.dedent(
        """
        <template>
          <widget>
            <label
              :text="f'Count: {count}'"
            />
            <button
              text="bump"
              @clicked="bump"
            />
          </widget>
        </template>

        <script>
        import collagraph as cg
        
        
        class App(cg.Component):
            def __init__(self, props):
                super().__init__(props)
                self.state["count"] = 0
                
            def bump(self):
                self.state["count"] += 1
        </script>
        """
    )
)

# Create a Collagraph instance with a PySide renderer 
# and register with the Qt event loop
gui = cg.Collagraph(
    renderer=cg.PySideRenderer(),
    event_loop_type=cg.EventLoopType.QT,
)
# Render the component into a container 
# (in this case the app but can be another widget)
app = QtWidgets.QApplication()
gui.render(cg.h(Counter), app)
app.exec()
```

For more examples, please take a look at the [examples folder](examples).

Currently there are two renderers:

* [PysideRenderer](collagraph/renderers/pyside_renderer.py): for rendering PySide6 applications
* [PygfxRenderer](collagraph/renderers/pygfx_renderer.py): for rendering 3D graphic scenes with [Pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx)

It is possible to create a custom Renderer using the [Renderer](collagraph/renderers/__init__.py) interface, to render to other UI frameworks, for instance wxPython, or even the browser DOM.


## Development

To try out Collagraph or start development, run:

```sh
# Basic dev setup (no pygfx or pyside)
poetry install
# Full dev setup
poetry install --with pyside --extras pyside --extras pygfx
# Run example:
poetry run python examples/layout-example.py
# Run test suite:
poetry run pytest
# Install git pre-commit hooks to make sure tests/linting passes before committing
poetry run pre-commit install
```
